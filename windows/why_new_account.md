# Should You Switch to a New Windows User Account for Work (e.g., "cecilia")?

This is a practical evaluation of whether it's worth migrating from your current account (e.g., "pc") to a new, dedicated user account for SSH and development.

## Key Questions to Ask

### 1. Will you frequently use SSH (e.g., SSH from Mac into Windows)?

* **Yes**: It's recommended to migrate. A dedicated user account improves security and keeps SSH permissions clean.
* **No**: You can keep using the current account. No need to complicate things.

### 2. Is your current "pc" user an administrator?

* **Yes (admin)**: Using it for SSH is risky. One mistake can open up the system.

  * If youâ€™re okay with the risk: stick with it.
  * If you prefer a safer setup: migrate and downgrade the "pc" account to a backup admin.
* **No**: Less risky, but still not ideal for long-term SSH use.

### 3. Will this machine be used for research/code/deployment long term?

* **Yes**: A clean working environment (like "cecilia") is valuable.

  * Isolated workspace
  * Separate SSH keys, configs, scripts, and Git repos
  * Easier to migrate/backup later

### 4. Does the "pc" account have personal apps (e.g., browser, WeChat, photos)?

* **Yes**: Keep "pc" for personal use; use "cecilia" for work.
* **No**: Full migration to "cecilia" makes your setup cleaner.

## Final Recommendations

| Scenario                                          | Recommendation                            |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| You want a secure and organized system            | Migrate to "cecilia" for work             |
| You just occasionally SSH or use Windows casually | Stick with "pc"                           |
| You plan to use Windows for remote work/computing | Strongly recommend migrating              |
| You want others to SSH into your Windows machine  | Let them use "cecilia", keep "pc" for you |

## TL;DR

If you're already configuring SSH and asking whether to switch accounts, it's worth spending 30 minutes to migrate. That effort buys you years of clean and secure setup.
