## What is PowerShell?

PowerShell is a tool you use in a **command-line window** to control your computer with text commands. It's made by Microsoft and is mainly used to **automate tasks**, especially on Windows.

Unlike the old Command Prompt, PowerShell is smarter — it doesn’t just read text; it works with **real data objects**, which makes it more powerful and easier to work with complex stuff.

## Why Use PowerShell?

* You can **automate boring tasks** (like renaming lots of files).
* You can **control your system** (start/stop programs, manage files, check settings).
* You can **write scripts** to do the same thing over and over without repeating yourself.

## What Makes It Different from Linux Terminal?

| PowerShell                | Linux Terminal (bash)                     |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Uses data objects         | Uses plain text                           |
| Works great on Windows    | Works great on Linux                      |
| Uses `Verb-Noun` commands | Uses short commands like `ls`, `cd`, `rm` |
| Script file: `.ps1`       | Script file: `.sh`                        |

---

## Example

```powershell
# Show all programs that are running
Get-Process

# Find files larger than 10MB
Get-ChildItem -Recurse | Where-Object { $_.Length -gt 10MB }
```

## In One Sentence

PowerShell is like the **super version of Command Prompt** — it helps you tell your computer what to do, quickly and automatically.

# PowerShell vs Windows Terminal — What's the Difference?

## TL;DR

| Feature                         | PowerShell                                           | Windows Terminal                                 |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| What is it?                    | A command-line shell and scripting language          | A terminal emulator for command-line tools       |
| What does it do?               | Runs commands like `Get-Process`, scripts (.ps1)     | Hosts PowerShell, CMD, WSL, Git Bash, etc.       |
| Is it standalone?              | Yes                                                 | No (used to run other shells)                    |
| Use case                       | Scripting, system administration, automation         | Managing multiple command-line environments       |

## Key Concept

PowerShell is the tool.  
Windows Terminal is the container that can host many tools.

Windows Terminal can run PowerShell, CMD, WSL, and more — each in its own tab.

## Example

```powershell
Get-Process
```

## Quick Comparison

| Task                                      | Recommended Tool     | Reason                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Running Python or R scripts               | PowerShell or CMD     | Simple execution of `.py` or `.R` files                               |
| Managing multiple tasks or environments   | Windows Terminal      | Tabbed interface for parallel workflows                               |
| Using Git, conda, WSL (Linux), or SSH     | Windows Terminal      | Supports multiple shells and profiles                                 |
| Automating tasks or scripting             | PowerShell            | Better scripting capabilities than CMD                                |
| Just running a one-off command or script  | PowerShell            | More modern and powerful than CMD                                     |

## Example Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Running a Python script

```powershell
python analyze.py
````

PowerShell handles this well. It supports aliases, piping, and works similarly to Unix-style terminals.

### Scenario 2: Working on multiple tasks simultaneously

* Tab 1: `python train_model.py`
* Tab 2: `Rscript stats_analysis.R`
* Tab 3: SSH into a remote server

Use **Windows Terminal** to open multiple tabs, each with a different environment (PowerShell, CMD, WSL, etc.).

---

## Summary

**Use PowerShell** for:

* Running scripts
* Automation
* System management
* Daily development tasks

**Use Windows Terminal** when:

* You want to manage multiple environments or sessions
* You prefer a more modern, customizable terminal interface

Windows Terminal can launch PowerShell, so you can have the best of both worlds.

---

## Optional Enhancements

* Set PowerShell as the default shell in Windows Terminal
* Create custom profiles that activate virtual environments or open project directories
* Use Windows Terminal to run and manage Jupyter, conda, or SSH workflows in parallel
